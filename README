=== COMPILING ===

To compile:
  ./gen ; ./configure ; make
You'll need libtool, automake, and autoconf, of course.  You'll need ncurses
(including headers) installed to compile the nafconsole plugin, which you'll
find very helpful in debugging.


=== RUNNING ===

For development, I run it something like this:
   timps/timpsd -c ~/timps.conf -d -D -M modules/nafconsole/.libs/libnafconsole.so
All messages will go to the log file specified in the config (see below), and
you will be given a "timps>" prompt (thanks to nafconsole).  From this
prompt, you can make RPC calls.  Try "call rpc->help()", for example.  The
most helpful right now is probably "call gnr->listnodes()" which will show
you the users currently online.

To run it as a daemon, use the much simpler:
   timpsd -c /etc/timps.conf
And it will fork and detach from the terminal into the background.  Note that
the config file path must be absolute, since daemonizing loses the current
working directory.


=== OFF-THE-RECORD MESSAGING ===

If you want to use the OTR module, you will need to install libotr and all of
its dependencies.  Get that from here:  http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/

The timps-otr module is not compiled by default.  Once you build the rest of
timps, go to modules/timpsotr and run make.

Add a [module=timps-otr] section to your timps.conf that contains at least the
keyfilepath parameter, as shown in the sample configuration.  (The directory
specified must be writable by timps.) Then, add: 
    -M modules/timpsotr/.libs/libtimpsotr.so
to your timpsd command line.  (You can have multiple -M options.)

If it doesn't seem to be working, make sure there are no errors near the
"loaded module timps-otr" line in the timps system log.  Depending on your
system, you may need to run something like /sbin/ldconfig, or add the location
of libotr.so to something like /etc/ld.so.conf.

WARNING: The OTR module is even more experimental/fragile than the rest of
timps!


=== SAMPLE CONFIGURATION ===

Configuration file suitable for development (all debugging on):
