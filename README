To compile:
  ./gen ; ./configure ; make
You'll need libtool, automake, and autoconf, of course.  You'll need ncurses
(including headers) installed to compile the nafconsole plugin, which you'll
find very helpful in debugging.

For development, I run it something like this:
   timps/timpsd -c ~/timps.conf -d -D -M les/nafconsole/.libs/libnafconsole.so
All messages will go to the log file specified in the config (see below), and
you will be given a "timps>" prompt (thanks to nafconsole).  From this
prompt, you can make RPC calls.  Try "call rpc->help()", for example.  The
most helpful right now is probably "call gnr->listnodes()" which will show
you the users currently online.

To run it as a daemon, use the much simpler:
   timpsd -c /etc/timps.conf
And it will fork and detach from the terminal into the background.  Note that
the config file path must be absolute, since daemonizing loses the current
working directory.


Configuration file suitable for development (all debugging on):
